# Bash Scripts

This repository contains two Bash scripts:

1) (Script1.md) System Utility Script – Presents a user menu with options to check disk space, show uptime, back up the Arena directory (retaining only the last 3 backups), parse a settings.conf file and execute the selected task.

2) (Script2.md) Arena File Manager – Automates the creation of an Arena_Boss directory with 5 randomly generated text files (10–20 lines each), sorts them by size and checks for the word "Victory", if the word is found then the file is moved to a directory named Victory_Archive
